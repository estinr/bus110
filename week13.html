        <h2>Week 13: Dec. 10, 2022</h2>
        <p>A concept from President Monson’s talk resonated with me a lot. Specifically from his talk, he spoke about
            today’s leprosy including greed, selfishness, and cruelty to name a few. Remember to make room in the inn
            for the Savior. Have a constant attitude of gratitude. Even when faced with tribulation, retrospectively be
            grateful for that experience.</p>
        <p>Another concept I liked is from Acton Hero: Larry North. What I took away from this video was that
            entrepreneurial endeavors are not for everyone. You must be able to take blows to the body most cannot
            handle. It might not be for you. You will never know until you try something on your list of ideas for a
            business. Be willing to wade through murky water. Have the courage and determination to trudge on through
            it. The only way onward is forward and through strife. When coming into contact with a mentor, absorb as
            much as possible. Make sure you internalize it and put it to good use. Having an attitude of belief is
            essential because it helps your community in the long run when you know what you are doing. I completely
            agree with Larry here when he says that failures are just as important as success. When his restaurant went
            out of business, he learned from that experience and learned to build better trenches or something new and
            better from that. Remember to learn from it, dust yourself off, and get up and walk.</p>
        <p>I am greatly appreciative of what I have absorbed from this class. Even though I am taking this class as an
            elective, I think I learned a lot more going in with an open mind than I would have if I have not taken this
            class as an elective. I enjoyed reading and listening to the different entrepreneurs and leaders from the
            course material. I internalized concepts of entrepreneurialism that I could not have guessed were attributes
            of an entrepreneur like finding the right person to take you on your hero’s journey or making sure you do
            some introspection to balance your efforts of work and personal life.</p>
