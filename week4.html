        <h2>Week 4: Oct. 8, 2022</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying Network and Database Administration. I like learning about it and it comes easy to me. It should pay well in the long run. But what I honestly love doing is coding frontend. I am not as proficient and effective at it as I am in the current field I am currently studying. They could change easily by simply putting in the time and research into coding for websites. This would be “an effective choice” with hours I would choose on my own and not having someone decided which customers I choose to serve. I could pick and choose and make my hours from day to day, week to week, as well as the holidays I would take off or not.

            I need to remember that I am my own person. I make my own choices on a daily basis. I need to remember that I already have it in me to make the choices for to create my own business. I just need to make goals to steer my ship that way. I feel like my career is at the precipice of decision. I can decide at any given moment where I would want to go, work for a small to medium size business or work for myself doing something I have not studied for all my life. The choice is mine.
