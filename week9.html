        <h2> Week 9: Nov. 13, 2022</h2>
        <p>Three main points and a couple of bonus points that stuck out to me this week from this week’s study content are the qualities of trustworthiness, a characteristic of what leadership is according to the former CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina, and lastly, how good is the enemy of great.</p>
        <p>The first point that I found interesting is the qualities of trustworthiness. There are three qualities of trustworthiness which are trusted by others first and they will hopefully subsequently trust you. It was interesting to me that organizations trust their customers first before all others. Item two is bakers and eaters. Eaters view the world as a zero-sum gain. They strive to get as much of the literary pie as possible. Ultimately, their gain is your loss. Bakers, on the other hand, are quite the opposite of eaters. They view the world as a non-sum gain. Their perspective of the world is an opportunity to bake more pie and in larger portions. Be a baker, people tend to trust them more than they do eaters.</p>
        <p>The second point that stuck out to me was the characteristics of leadership are capability, collaboration, and character. The speaker in the video only touched on the first characteristic so, I will only touch on that. Capability includes but is not limited to the importance of listening for an answer when asking the right questions. Creativity promotes new ideas, taking risks, and innovation. The idea here is to keep learning all life-long. That is what the Prophet heeds us to do so that is what I am in the midst of doing and will perpetuate throughout my life.</p>
        <p>The last point is from good to great. Which is a book written by Jim Collins. The first chapter of the book is basically self-titled: good is the enemy of great. There are three main points that go with this. The first is to stay humble while being passionate about your work. The second is to have the right people on your bus. I don’t quite understand this part, but it is wise to have a bus full of the smartest, wisest, and kindest people in your organization. Believe in yourself. Believe in your product or service, otherwise, people will not trust you or your product. Strive for excellency and focus on perfection.</p>
