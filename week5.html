        <h2>Week 5: Oct. 15, 2022</h2>
        <p>A few things stuck out to me from the study this week The first one was from Randy Komisar with having a
            portfolio of passion. “Walking through one door of ten, nine doors just closed, but looking forward, ten
            more just opened ahead of you.” Optimization will drive me crazy. Don’t be so finicky with optimization per
            iteration that distracts it from the main objective.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second thing is from the video about entrepreneurs not being rock stars. That seems a little
            presumptuous if you ask me; a bit limiting. Why not shoot for the stars? You can either work for the man or
            you can be the man. You can be your own man. You have the choice to make an impact on whichever path you
            decide to take, the only difference is the effort put into it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third and last thing I want to note is there are no wrong answers in choosing my passion portfolio. I
            choose whatever goes in the portfolio and no one else can decide for me because it is from my personality
            and desires. I may choose to focus on something completely different from what I am currently studying or go
            in a different direction entirely.
