        <h2> Week 8: Nov. 6, 2022</h2>
        <p>There are a few things I learned from this week’s study material. The first principle is from Jeffery R.
            Holland’s wife, Patricia T. Holland, which is “The only limitations you have are those you set on
            yourselves. All of the tools and texts are here, right at your hand.” I agree with this quote completely. If
            I put my mind to it, I can do anything I wish to accomplish. The key here is to think of all the resources
            that are at my disposal within reason. My computer is easily accessible almost as easy as my smartphone
            where I can launch research cycles into anything I need to look from school projects to how to make synth
            music. I need to keep pushing forward and cannot underestimate myself in all that I do. Never doubting, and
            trust in the Lord, with Him I can do amazing things.</p>
        <p> The second thing I learned is to embrace thinking backward. This is essentially the concept of creating
            ultimate goals and forwardly working my way toward those goals I have created. There is a balance between
            running a business and a business running you. Do the former. Be consistent in carrying out business tasks
            and persona. It must match up and be homogenous throughout the business modal. </p>
        <p> The last concept I took away from this week’s study is from the “Mormon Message” Good Things to Come. I
            remember sharing this specific video with those whom I taught throughout my mission. It is always
            encouraging to hear these affirming words from Jeffery R. Holland. What I internalize from it is to not quit
            while trying. Keep walking my walk. Keep trying even when I fail. Everything will be all right in the end
            and believe in good things to come. Trust in the Lord, keep trying my best and everything will turn out for
            the best for me in the end. </p>
