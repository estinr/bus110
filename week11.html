        <h2>Week 11: Nov. 26, 2022</h2>
        <p>According to the speech, I somewhat disagree with some of the things said in it. Seems like this speaker like
            to go for the “wow” or “oooh” factor rather than tugging at your heartstrings with ethos. My attitude and
            his attitude toward money differ. I believe money is a fact of mortality. Currency is attached to mortality,
            the Terrestrial world. I perceive a difference between monetary needs and necessities and the need for
            monetary materials. I see the necessity of currency. It enables me to provide for me and my family when I
            get to that point. It is very difficult to write about something I have not experienced yet firsthand. I
            have taken self-reliance classes before and learned about healthy saving and budgeting. There can be a fine
            line between need and justification. “Do we really need to go to that theme park?” or “Do I need to spend
            more on warm clothes for the new season?”. There are qualifying questions that need to be asked.</p>
        <p>This is the perfect Segway into how my view of money can affect the way I live. I am able to choose what I
            spend it on and how I spend it. There are many choices I make from day to day throughout my life. It is
            important to realize which choices shift and shape my financial future. I chose to continue my academic
            career over starting my financial career in good faith that I graduate with a bachelor’s degree in science
            technology.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><h4>Follow the Lord</h4>I know that if I seek the Lord earnestly and faith in him, I will receive blessings.</li>
            <li><h4>Keep the Commandments</h4>Keeping the commandments including paying to tithe and fast offerings is and has been a tremendous
                blessing in my life.</li>
            <li><h4>Become Self-Reliant</h4>Money is always in the back of my mind. I am always motivated to think about how I can move out of my
                parent’s house and be able to provide for myself and my future family.</li>
            <li><h4>Learn the Laws of Blessings</h4>Learning about spiritual laws have been a spiritual journey for me. I think how they can bless me and
                the lives of others as I carry out the ways of and attributes of Christ.</li>
            <li><h4>Serve the Needy</h4>This leads me to the last rule of prosperity which is feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend to the
                sick, and free those who are imprisoned including Spirit Prison.</li>
