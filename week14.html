        <h2>Week 14: Dec. 14, 2022</h2>
        <p>I believe I am the wrong person to ask this question. If I were to transfer the bit of information I took
            away from this course to students and others would be, to get anything out of something that is difficult to
            extract from. Squeeze out every ounce of knowledge from the material and internalize it. What I mean by
            internalizing is to truly ponder what you have taken from the course material, what it would mean to you in
            your life, and apply it in your daily life. There will be times that it will be difficult to apply a few
            things and there will be other times when it would be really simple to apply a concept learned; everyone is
            different, they learn differently, they apply different things differently than others, and that is
            perfectly okay.</p>
        <p>My last piece of advice to someone if they were serious about starting a venture would be to think about
            their future. I mean really contemplate it. Whom do they see in their life? What do they think about
            managing their own business? What do they see in their distant future? What about their children? It is not
            good to work alone. Find a suitable partner to work with. Whether that is your spouse or friend from college
            or another venture. Settle on what is best for you, your family, and your business’s future. Perhaps it
            might not work out with your partner or the business for you, and it may be jeopardizing your personal and
            or family life. Choose God first, choose your family over business. There will be other opportunities for
            your future. Life doors open and close all the time. It is up to you which door to choose at which time.</p>
        <p>I am not one for lecturing myself. My last piece of advice would be to listen to your gut or your intuition.
            Usually, your intuition is the Holy Ghost and I know that he knows what is best for you because that is the
            voice of the Lord speaking directly to you. Study as much as you can as much as possible. Listen to your
            notes and work as efficiently as best you can. Do the best you can, and others will recognize that you are
            earnestly trying at something you are passionate about or not passionate about. Do not be afraid of failure.
            It is an intrinsic part of life. It is a chance of business ventures. Throw everything you’ve got at the
            wall see if something stick; some will stick and some will not. The odds are in your favor when you give in
            100 percent of your effort. Sometimes your 100 percent of your effort may be 50 percent or 200 percent of
            others in comparison. Try not to compare yourself to others in a negative way that it brings you down. Look
            at someone who works more efficiently or more wisely, shadow them, see what they do differently to improve
            your work. Beware of pride. Pride is a silly thing to get in the way of progression and improvement.</p>
