            It’s interesting to me to hear the commonalities from these businessmen. A few traits I pick up are honesty,
            integrity, and loyalty. Another common demeanor they convey is confidence through their presentations and
            appearance. It takes practice and discipline to home in on all of these traits and may take a lifetime to
            master. Businessmen should not be prideful and be humble enough to take risk and make mistakes; own the
            mistakes to learn from them later in life.

            The first thing I noticed about these videos was that most of them were published in 2001. So, I take these
            videos and their advice on current day business with a grain of salt. Take the advice of not using a website
            for example. I thought that was funny. Most of business today is conducted over the Internet. Instagram,
            TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter are a handful of prime examples of e-commerce. Sure, you can take to the skies
            in an attempt to make connections with those who you do business with. The effectiveness of business will
            remain in circuitry.

            I found it interesting that a must have for a startup was to have a supportive family or be supportive for
            your family, it wasn’t quite clear which to me. That goes inline with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Put God
            first then your family then everything else will fall into place when done correctly. Pay close attention to
            what your family is interested in. Participate in their activities. Be supportive in all that they do that they may be successful.
