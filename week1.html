            As I watched, read, and studied the videos and articles, a thought kept making its round in mind: “Am I even
            in the right class? Am I going to be an entrepreneur one day?” Maybe not today or next year but perhaps
            further down the road. Who knows what the future will hold. Like Reid Hoffman said in the Career-building
            tools video, “which do I use?”. I believe it is a good thing to stock up my career tools arsenal with tools
            that I will and can use in the near and far future for me.</div>
            <p> I am already thinking about my personal brand from my talents and skills. I am now beginning to realize how
            I could utilize my skills and knowledge in the business world. This is one part of my personal brand now I
            need to figure out the other few parts that make it complete. This could very well work in the long run. It
            may be challenging but it will be rewarding too. I once betrayed myself before taking online classes. I was
            at LDS Business College and did not have the tools necessary for me to achieve the needs and goals in my
            life and school. This time around, I feel that I have more tools at my arms reach for me to help me achieve
            those goals toward success and life accomplishment.</p>
            <p>As I study the course material while studying and searching the Scriptures, I know that Heavenly Father will
            assist me in unimaginable ways for me to succeed in life. He will guide me through life’s toughest
            decisions. The Holy Ghost will light the path to the Savior. The Savior will be there for me as a perfect
            example to aide me in my endeavors. Business is not my first choice for a career. Perhaps it will be my plan
            B or plan Z for my plan A of information technology and the like.</p>
