        <h2>Week 7: Oct. 29, 2022</h2>
        <p>The second habit, “begin with the end in mind”, speaks to me the most. This habit is not a habit but rather a lifestyle. When starting on a project either with school or a hobby project, I always think of what the end product could end up looking like. It is useful to have this kind of thinking process to help manage obstacles and hiccups along the way. It is better to think ahead than to not think ahead at all. This skill takes patience and practice. With time, it will become better and will get the hang of it. </p>
        <p>The seven habits will help me fill my life with passion and purpose as I hone my skills and habits of skills for success. I see private victories as a stepping stone on the way to public victories. Private victories could include learning a programming language, landing a new job, or receiving new clients. Public victories could include winning a Nobel Peace Prize, winning a race, or giving to a charity for philanthropic purposes. This is the perfect mixture of passion and purpose. When I love doing something for the sake of learning it, that’s passion. When I share that passion of what I learn with others, that becomes purpose. I want to help them learn, grow, and create for themselves. That is what I call a publicized private victory. </p>
        <p>A concept I learned from this week was from Passion vs. Money video. A thought I took away from there was to be resourceful in anything and everything I do. This is how I live my life today. I use the resources that are at hand that are literally at my fingertips to my advantage of learning and expanding my knowledge base in the world of business and information technology. These two worlds often collide and merge together seamlessly and remain that way. Both of them are ever-expanding and ever-growing in knowledge and mass. It is crucial to learn about how to wield knowledge resourcefully in each. </p>
