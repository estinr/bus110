        <h2>Week 12: Dec. 3, 2022</h2>
        <p>I believe that virtue and integrity are vital and integral to an economy because that is what most people build their economy upon. It is integrity that upholds one’s own virtues. Without it, the world would run amuck in chaotic anarchy. Having virtue is quite a burden to bear, it comes at a cost and is a blessing all the while. Integrity is the bread and butter of a business. Without it, there would be losses, setbacks, and friction internally eventually slowing down the company all together.</p>
        <p>According to Charles Handy, the real justification for the existence of a business is making a profit for philanthropic purposes. I lean toward agreeing with this notion. Suppose I am Steve Jobs, and I created the Apple 2 or the Lisa computers. These are consumer products that anyone can buy on the market if they have the means to do so. Coca-Cola is another prime example of philanthropic means. I am unaware of the statistical numbers in their business, though I know a lot of the company’s efforts provide the means for clean water in developing countries worldwide.</p>
        <p>I agree with the motion that Handy of turning all shareholders into drones and essentially do business for the company. They would be the grunt foot soldiers for the company and carry out the services and messages to consumers. That is how business seems to work. Another principle that I agree with from this article was having better corporate behavior and democracy. I believe these attributes are beneficial for business in the long run. “Property imposes duties. Its use should also serve the public weal.” This quote is from the German constitution, which the Constitution of the United States of America lacks but various companies are sympathetic toward these ideas. (Handy, pg. 7) The purpose of a company is to accomplish what one person cannot do alone if they did not have the means to do so otherwise.</p>
