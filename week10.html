        <h2>Week 10: Nov. 20, 2022</h2>
        <p>A few topics from this week’s study material are from the talk given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks, Think Big with Taylor Richards, and Your Emotional Fingerprint with Jim Ritchie the co-founder of Launching Leaders.</p>
        <p>	The first topic is from the talk given by Elder Oaks. What resonated with me from this talk was that Jesus Christ challenges us to become something while the world teaches us to know something. As we become Christlike, we take on his many attributes. I continually strive to become like Christ by working on an attribute I think I need to focus on. Charity is an appropriate attribute of his for this time of year. Charity is why Christmas is my favorite holiday. Charity is the pure love of Christ; it is not an act but a state of existence.</p>
        <p>The second topic is from Think Big with Taylor Richards. He was entertaining to watch. He was in the boating industry. He advertised boats in the Boating Industry Magazine. He was invited to a convention. He ranked 11th in North America. He went again later. He was ranked 6th in North America. “Don’t over-underestimate yourself.” When I involve the Lord, I can do great things I never thought possible. Dream huge and land big.</p>
        <p>The third and final topic is from Your Emotional Fingerprint with Jim Ritchie. Your Emotional Fingerprint is a program that helps you develop a map of your feelings and emotions. It’s a response chart for the situations in life. There are two wolves in battle within yourself: the first is the evil wolf which represents anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The second is the good one: which represents joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and even faith. The one that wins is the one you feed. There is a battle in each of us. Find what drives you. Learn about the success of others. Feel important.</p>
