        <h2>Week 6: Oct. 20, 2022</h2>
        <p>There are three most important takeaways for me from the study material. The first is self-mastery which has
            two elements within. The element is to set your sail of moral standards. The second is willpower or the wind
            that carries your vessel. I believe it is important for me to create self-governing rules, goals, and
            standards to prepare myself for success and prosperity. I think it is crucial to focus on myself by creating
            these standards before starting a business and/or a family so I could teach employees and family members by
            example and direction. Work my way toward discipleship through discipline, dedication, and focus.</p>
        <p>The second takeaway is like the first though nonetheless different. It is to make rules for yourself as an
            entrepreneur. These rules can be anything I want them to be, really. I have a mind for philanthropy so I
            would make a rule or two with that in mind. I would make a rule about how to treat others including myself,
            employees, others, and family with kindness. I would make several rules for a buffer for time with my family
            and work environment. It is highly important to have that balance solidified. Without rules or morals, chaos
            will reign, and I would be lonely, I don’t want that.</p>
        <p>The last takeaway encompasses the first two takeaways. By setting rules for myself, I will progress my way
            toward a better self. The title of the video is “Loyalty to God and Family”. Part of being loyal to God is
            being loyal to yourself and your family. The video covers one of my family principles from the material this
            week which is never time crunch God. Never time crunch your family. Never be too busy to accept a calling in
            the church. If I am, then I need to rethink my priorities. My future business and or start-ups won’t matter
            in a thousand years, my greatest legacy will be my family and service to the Lord.</p>
