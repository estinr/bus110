        <h2>Week 2: Sept. 23, 2022</h2><br>
        <div>If I were to be honest with myself and the world, I have always viewed life as one grand experiment. This
            is how I learn from life of life for eternity. Trial and error can lead to success eventually after made
            effort from the actor. It is a different story, perhaps on the other side of the coin of life finding my
            life’s calling. It takes some experience and time going through the avenues of life. It also depends on the
            decisions I make with that experience and knowledge to serve others or to be dormant and slothful. I like
            adventure. I like diversity and change. That is why I actively choose everyday to serve and love others.
        </div>
        <p> I think it is necessary to keep track of incremental and quantifiable failures so that I can learn from them
            and create an improved iteration from the last few. That single thought helps motivate me to keep at it and
            stick with what I am doing. I may not fail over five thousand times at something, perhaps I am not pushing
            myself hard enough to try, try, and try again. Though, I do have the motivation and will do so. </p>
        <p>I like the perspective of the brick walls in my life simply being an objective in my life I can work around
            or break though; something to figure out how to overcome and succeed. In this same video, Tom Kelley’s
            parents let him write on the walls of his room complex math equations. I might devote a chalk wall or a
            plexiglass wall in my house to encourage creativity and set that energy free to create, fail, try, fail, try
            again and perhaps succeed. I will lead my life in a such a way that will promote creativity, free thought,
            and full dreams of my family’s lives. Let them be their own masters of each of their own domain.</p>
